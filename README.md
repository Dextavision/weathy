# weathy
A little fun side project to practice Flutter. May the weather be with you!

## What is Weathy?
Weathy is a Flutter App that fetches the current weather data (from the OpenWeather API: https://openweathermap.org/current) and display it in a nice way to the user. It is a learning project to practice flutter and work with APIs inside Flutter and Dart.

## Features
Fetch the weather data at the start of the App. Its hard-coded for cologne but you can change it if you like to. You can also enhance the feature set and fetch the user geolocation and show the weather based on this. Feel free to experiment with it!

## How to use it?
You can fetch this repo and if you have Flutter installed you are good to go. You just need a OpenWeather API key. You can get it from their website for free. I put mine into a file that isnt tracked by git to keep it private. Just put it into a Dart file into a new class and get it through a static method. Thats how i did it.

And as always, Develop Yourself!
